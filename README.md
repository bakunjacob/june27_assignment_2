# 🌱 LifeLikelike: Ultra Everyday Simulator

*Welcome to LifeLikelike – the hyper-realistic life simulation where nothing works quite right, and that's how we like it.*

In this not-at-all-legally-infringing life simulator, you’ll guide your digital creatures (Zogs) through the absurdities of modern life: paying rent with marshmallows, making eye contact with houseplants, and suffering spontaneous existential yoga.

## 🧾 Description

LifeLikelike is a life-simulation parody project, created as part of a GitHub learning experience. The game doesn’t exist. Or does it? (It doesn’t.)

This README is here to help you practice creating issues, pull requests, merges, and to give your terminal a reason to exist beyond sadness.
